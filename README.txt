okay so.. project hermes, at the moment, is mostly client > server.. that's fine for home automation where the clients have info to give to the server which then does stuff..
but not that great for project room-screen, where the clients just display server data.


IDEA: use modules for the home-automation project like: anime tracker, weather update, email, etc etc.
somehow enable these modules.

anyway, get aphrodite smiling first.
it's not the biggest smile, but it's doable. everything is in aphrodite/testing.
