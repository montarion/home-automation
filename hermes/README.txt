welcome to (project?) hermes, the messemger of the gods.

the plan is to use broadcasts to establish a connection between the server and the nodes(different pi's),
and to then share data and sync n atuff.

DONE1. See who's on the network

DONE2. set up secure connection with nodes found on network using the stuff inside testing/

DONE3. transmit whatever data you want one on one


##INSTRUCTIONS##

place the server folder on server
place the client folder on clients

run start.py on the respective machines.

!! Adding more than one client to the server at a time doesn't work, please add them one at a time for now.
